# MichelsonLab
A GitHub repository containing my laboratory project for PHY300 (Experimental Physics Laboratory 2)
The laboratory involved performing experiments with a Michelson Interferometer. 
The PDF file is the lab report which was submitted to the instructor, and the IPYNB file contains the Python code which I wrote for data visualisation.
